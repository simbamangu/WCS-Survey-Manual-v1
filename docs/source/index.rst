WCS Aerial Survey Manual
===================================

This is an online version of the manual for the WCS Flight Programme, originally published in 2008 under a Creative Commons license.

Things have moved on a lot since then, and the manual will be updated with a Version 2.0 or replaced in a parallel effort.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. This has been converted from an original DOCX to RST and hosted on GitHub, and has not been fully organised into sections.
